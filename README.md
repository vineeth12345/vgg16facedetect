# vgg16facedetect
task was to create a Face Recognition model over pretrained model VGG16 using transferlerning.

step1:i collected my images using the opencv photo click program and stored in one folder for training and testing my model using these images

step2:i used Mobilenet pretrained model and trained the fc layer with my dataset to recognise the faces.i got a great accuracy of about 93% while creating a model.

step3:i fit the model for predicting the o/p.
